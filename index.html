								We made a landing page for an English language school. We were very pleased with the
								work done. Anastasia had a great first online meeting, analyzed our site (which later we
								redesigned and transferred to another platform). The team made an analysis of
								competitors and clearly explained how to properly structure the site. Feedback is almost
								24/7. Everything is clear, without water. This is not the first time we are making a
								website, usually the first consultation begins with a question ”What would you like?”.
								And I don’t know what I would like. This team didn’t ask such questions, which for me
								immediately removed all questions about the level of professionalism. We have never
								regretted about the choice, I sincerely recommend this agency to everyone!

								<p>Anastasia and her team redesigned and finalized our scary site.</p>
								<p>This was my third experience, I previously worked with companies that are painful to
									remember.
									Anastasia explained everything clearly and thoughtfully answered my most ridiculous
									questions.
									I know that I had a very complex project on a non-standard CMS, but they didn’t
									immerse me deeply into complex processes, but they explained very clearly: what can
									be done, how it will look, how much time is needed and what is the cost.</p>
								<p>There is a sense of complete involvement in the work. All improvements were sometimes
									made in a few hours. This is especially important for me after cooperation with
									other companies, where any “clarification from the programmer” takes several days.
								</p>
								<p>Special thanks for the chic design of my site. Every time I experience aesthetic
									pleasure, I look at it, and I already collect rave reviews from customers💜</p>
								<p>I want to note that my cooperation with Anastasia's team has just begun and I am
									already filling out my new Wishlist and looking forward to their implementation!

								<p>I have a rather complex online store for a candy store.</p>
								<p>And from the bottom of my heart I thank Anastasia and her team for the amazing work!!
								</p>
								<p>ogether we have come a long way from the choice of the structure and the basis of the
									entire work of the store to the details and nuances in the goods and store. For me,
									the great involvement of the team and the speed of implementation turned out to be
									very valuable - I am insanely busy in offline work and I need to be periodically
									pulled out of there. I would like to note the exact understanding by the team of
									aspects related to the psychology of buyers, the convenience of placing orders on
									the site. The design accurately reflects my concept, for me it is very important.
									The site is integrated with the warehouse program.</p>
								<p>We are in the process of completing the work, but I can say for sure that the value
									of the work for me turned out to be higher than the price. The process was a
									pleasure, the result - 100% hit in my needs. My most sincere recommendation!!!</p>

								<p>Before the new year, I ordered a website from this team. I am an architect, designer,
									studio owner and a very busy person, I had no time to deal with the site, its
									content and concept. Everything from beginning to end, according to my requirements,
									was done with her professional team. Fast, clear and creative. Everything is thought
									out. Comfortable and beautiful, aesthetics plays a very important role for me -
									Anastasia helped, gave advices and asked questions in order to make selling website.
									Meticulous attention to every detail - that's what you pay for and delegate! </p>
								<p>I recommend this guys to everyone! I think we will continue to cooperate further. I
									have more ideas that Anastasia and her team can easily implement, my website is

								<p>We made a website for a detailing auto studio. I really liked the approach and professionalism of the team. The niche was new for them, but marketers perfectly understood all the intricacies, helped to analyze the competitors. All my wishes were taken into account and “I wanted something I didn’t know what”. 100% match with design - love at first sight.</p>
								<p>Most importantly, the site began to bring 10 times more leads than its predecessor, people began to actively visit it. This agency helped to choose the optimal functionality and there were more interactions with the site.</p>
								<p>And most importantly, after the completion of the project, Anastasia is always in touch and helps to analyze the results.</p>
								<p>This agency does not just create a website, it gives the business a second wind, closes holes in marketing and create image of the company, because the design is developed with special elegance.</p>
								<p>Worth every penny, investment paid off in 1.5 months. Recommended!</p>
